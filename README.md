## 🚀 Project Overview

**ServiceNow Oversight Engine** is a platform governance and monitoring tool that gives organizations **full visibility into their ServiceNow instance**. It identifies risky customizations, technical debt, and CMDB inconsistencies, providing **health, risk, and compliance metrics** to executives, platform owners, and architects.

---

## 🎯 Target Users

- **CIOs and CTOs** – Require a high-level view of platform health, risk, and compliance to make strategic decisions.  
- **ServiceNow Platform Owners** – Responsible for managing technical debt, upgrade readiness, and governance of the platform.  
- **ServiceNow Administrators / Architects** – Need actionable insights to maintain system integrity, optimize performance, and prevent risky customizations.  

> In short: Anyone responsible for **platform health, governance, and decision-making**.

## ⚠️ Core Problems Addressed

1. Lack of visibility into **risky or inefficient customizations**.  
2. **Incomplete or inconsistent CMDBs**, leading to poor decision-making and operational risk.  
3. Platform **performance issues go unnoticed** until they impact users.  
4. Upgrade planning is **manual and risky**, with no automated assessment of technical debt.  
5. Enterprises spend **thousands on audits and consulting** due to the absence of automated governance tools.
